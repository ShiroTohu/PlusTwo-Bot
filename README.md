# +2 Bot
Inspired by [Jerma985](https://www.twitch.tv/jerma985).

## Overview
The +2 Bot is a discord bot that tracks the amount of +2's and -2's amongst users.

This bot was inspired by the Jerma's stream where he and Etalyx set out to beat *Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days* in just under 4 hours. For every funny joke they made 2 minutes was added to the 4 hour timer, for every unfunny joke they made 2 minutes was substracted from the timer. The chat would spam "+2" or "-2" to voice their opinions on whether a joke was good or bad. Jerma and Etalyx beat the game with just 45 seconds remaining.
