For every funny joke they made, two minutes were added to the timer; for every unfunny joke, two minutes were subtracted. The chat would spam \"+2\" or \"-2\" to voice their opinions on whether a joke was good or bad. Jerma and Etalyx beat the game with just 45 seconds remaining.</p>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>This bot is supported by all major operating systems</p> <ul> <li>Windows</li> <li>MacOS</li> <li>Linux</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#environment-variables-in-env-file","title":"Environment variables in .env file","text":"<p>The required environment variables</p> <pre><code>DISCORD_TOKEN =\nCLIENT_ID = \n</code></pre> <p>Non-essential environment variables (used for production)</p> <pre><code>// not required\nDB_NAME = \nDB_USER = \nDB_PASSWORD = \nDB_HOST = \nDB_TEST_HOST = \nCLIENT_ID = \n</code></pre>"},{"location":"CreatingBot/","title":"Creating the Discord Bot","text":""},{"location":"EnvironmentVariables/","title":"Setting up Environment Variables","text":"<p>Create a file in the root directory named .env and assign their respective values.
